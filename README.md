# Advanced Secure User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control System

Welcome to the **Advanced Secure User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control System**! This system provides a comprehensive, secure, and scalable solution for user authentication and authorization, leveraging modern security practices and techniques. It supports features like JWT-based authentication, dynamic role and permission management, rate limiting, and much more!

---

## üöÄ Features

### 1. **User Authentication System**
- **Secure Registration & Login:** Users can securely register and log in with password hashing.
- **JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens are used for session management, ensuring stateless authentication.
- **Token Expiry & Refresh:** Tokens are set to expire after a specified period and can be refreshed without requiring re-login.

### 2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- **Dynamic Role Management:** Users are assigned roles like **Admin**, **User**, and **Moderator**, with specific permissions tied to each role.
- **Admin Controls:** Admins can assign, modify, and remove roles dynamically via API.
- **Permission-Based Access:** Access to resources is determined by the user's role and assigned permissions.

### 3. **Enhanced Security Features**
- **Rate Limiting:** To protect against DoS attacks, rate-limiting middleware is used to restrict the number of requests per user in a given time frame.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** User inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- **Brute Force Prevention:** Multiple failed login attempts will lock the user account temporarily, requiring additional steps to reset.
- **Session Management:** Tokens are securely stored in HTTP-only cookies, ensuring protection from XSS attacks.

### 4. **Authorization & Permission Management**
- **Dynamic Permission API:** Allows admins to modify user permissions without modifying the codebase.
- **Permission Enforcement:** Middleware ensures that users only access resources they have permission for, preventing unauthorized access.

### 5. **Advanced Logging and Monitoring**
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Tracks user login attempts, role assignments, and changes in real-time for enhanced security monitoring.
- **Audit Trails:** Logs all significant actions, providing transparency for any security incidents.

### 6. **Scalability & Performance Optimizations**
- **Efficient Query Handling:** The system optimizes API response times to handle large traffic without performance degradation.
- **Centralized Authentication Service:** Scalable design for handling multiple microservices or systems, ensuring future-proofing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-authentication-rbac.git

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
    cd secure-authentication-rbac

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   DB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   The server will start on port 3000 by default. You can change this in the .env file.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations
**JWT Authentication**: JWT tokens are used for secure, stateless authentication. Ensure that the secret key is kept safe.
**Rate Limiting**: Protects against DDoS attacks by limiting the number of requests a user can make.
**Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt to ensure they are securely stored in the database.
**Input Validation**: User inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common attacks such as XSS and SQL Injection.

## üìà Advanced Features
**Permission-Based Access Control**: Ensure that users can only access endpoints they're authorized for based on their roles and permissions.
**Logging and Monitoring**: All login attempts, role assignments, and permission changes are logged for auditing purposes.
**Scalable Design**: Built with scalability in mind, ready to be extended to a multi-service architecture if required.
